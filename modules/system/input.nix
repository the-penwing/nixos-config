  # INPUT — keyd kernel-level key remapping
  # Works on all connected keyboards (built-in + Logi Pebble 2)
  #
  # Scope is intentionally narrow to avoid conflicting with the
  # existing Hyprland bindings in hyprland.conf.  Specifically:
  #
  #   Excluded (already bound in Hyprland):
  #     Super+C  → cliphist picker
  #     Super+V  → togglefloating
  #     Super+S  → special workspace
  #     Super+Q  → killactive
  #     Super+E  → dolphin
  #     Super+1–9,0 → workspace switching
  #     Right Alt → compose key (kb_options = compose:ralt)
  #     XF86 media / brightness → already handled by Hyprland
  #
  #   Remapped here (no Hyprland binding):
  #     Super+Z → Ctrl+Z  (undo — universal in every app)
  #     Super+X → Ctrl+X  (cut  — universal in every app)
  #     Super+A → Ctrl+A  (select-all — universal in every app)
  #
  # Caps Lock layer
  # ──────────────
  #   Tap  → Escape  (great for neovim)
  #   Hold → activate the [capslock] layer below
  #
  #   Media:       Space=play/pause   ,=prev   .=next   M=mute
  #   Volume:      Left=vol-down      Right=vol-up
  #   Brightness:  Up=bright+         Down=bright-
  #   Terminal:    C=^C  D=^D  Z=^Z  L=^L  U=^U  A=^A  E=^E  K=^K  W=^W
  #   Session:     Q → Super+` which Hyprland binds to wlogout
